The intuition Value Iteration works is because values propagate through the state space by means of local updates. This point will we more clear after we encounter the visualisation. For more information you can refer to **Section 17.2** of the book. \n",

    "### Value Iteration\n",
    "Using the pseudocode above we will implement the value iteration algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation takes as inputs two parameters, an MDP to solve and epsilon, the maximum error allowed in the utility of any state. It returns a dictionary containing utilities where the keys are the states and values represent utilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Value Iteration starts with arbitrary initial values for the utilities, calculates the right-hand side of the Bellman equation and plugs it into the left-hand side, thereby updating the utility of each state from the utilities of its neighbours. \n",
    "This is repeated until the utility vector we update reaches an equilibrium. \n",
    "It works on the principle of _Dynamic Programming_ - using precomputed information to simplify the subsequent computation. \n",
    "If $U_i(s)$ is the utility value for state $s$ at the $i$ th iteration, the iteration step, called Bellman update, looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{i+1}(s) \\leftarrow R(s) + \\gamma \\max_{a \\epsilon A(s)} \\sum_{s'} P(s'\\ |\\ s,a)U_{i}(s') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, `value_iteration` has an infinite loop. How do we decide when to stop iterating? \n",
    "The concept of _contraction_ successfully explains the convergence of value iteration. \n",
    "Refer to **Section 17.2.3** of the book for a detailed explanation. \n",
    "In the algorithm, we calculate a value $delta$ that measures the difference in the utilities of the current time step and the previous time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta = \\max{(\\delta, \\begin{vmatrix}U_{i + 1}(s) - U_i(s)\\end{vmatrix})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value of delta decreases as the values of $U_i$ converge.\n",
    "We terminate the algorithm if the $\\delta$ value is less than a threshold value determined by the hyperparameter _epsilon_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\lt \\epsilon \\frac{(1 - \\gamma)}{\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the Bellman update is a _contraction_ by a factor of $gamma$ on the space of utility vectors. \n",
    "Hence, from the properties of contractions in general, it follows that `value_iteration` always converges to a unique solution of the Bellman equations whenever $gamma$ is less than 1.\n",
    "We then terminate the algorithm when we reach a reasonable approximation.\n",
    "In practice, it often occurs that the policy $pi$ becomes optimal long before the utility function converges. For the given 4 x 3 environment with $gamma = 0.9$, the policy $pi$ is optimal when $i = 4$ (at the 4th iteration), even though the maximum error in the utility function is stil 0.46. This can be clarified from **figure 17.6** in the book. Hence, to increase computational efficiency, we often use another method to solve MDPs called Policy Iteration which we will see in the later part of this notebook. \n",
