    "A Markov model is basically a chain-structured Bayesian Network in which there is one state for each time step and each node has an identical probability distribution.\n",
    "The first node, however, has a different distribution, called the prior distribution which models the initial state of the process.\n",
    "A state in a Markov model depends only on the previous state and the latest evidence and not on the states before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Hidden Markov Model** or **HMM** is a special case of a Markov model in which the state of the process is described by a single discrete random variable.\n",
    "The possible values of the variable are the possible states of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to model a process with two or more state variables?\n",
    "In that case, we can still fit the process into the HMM framework by redefining our state variables as a single \"megavariable\".\n",
    "We do this because carrying out inference on HMMs have standard optimized algorithms.\n",
    "A HMM is very similar to an MDP, but we don't have the option of taking actions like in MDPs, instead, the process carries on as new evidence appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a HMM is truncated at a fixed length, it becomes a Bayesian network and general BN inference can be used on it to answer queries.\n",

    "Before we start, it will be helpful to understand the structure of a temporal model. We will use the example of the book with the guard and the umbrella. In this example, the state $$\\textbf{X}$$ is whether it is a rainy day (`X = True`) or not (`X = False`) at Day $\\textbf{t}$. In the sensor or observation model, the observation or evidence $\\textbf{U}$ is whether the professor holds an umbrella (`U = True`) or not (`U = False`) on **Day** $\\textbf{t}$.
