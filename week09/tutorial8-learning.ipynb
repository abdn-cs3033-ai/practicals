    "\n",
    "The key ingredient for machine learning algorithms is Data. Thus, we start by reviewing a Dataset class for transparent access from our learning algorithms. \n",
    "A lot of the datasets we will work with are .csv files (although other formats are supported too). There is a collection of sample datasets ready to use [on aima-data](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-data), and we use a subset we placed on [our branch](./aima-data). In such files, each line corresponds to one item/measurement. Each individual value in a line represents a *feature* and usually there is a value denoting the *class* of the item. We encode data using the [DataSet](learning.py#L8) class (which we import in the next Python cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **examples**: Holds the items of the dataset. Each item is a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **attrs**: The indexes of the features (by default in the range of [0,f), where *f* is the number of features). For example, `item[i]` returns the feature at index *i* of *item*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **attrnames**: An optional list with attribute names. For example, `item[s]`, where *s* is a feature name, returns the feature of name *s* in *item*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **target**: The attribute a learning algorithm will try to predict. By default the last attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **inputs**: This is the list of attributes without the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **values**: A list of lists which holds the set of possible values for the corresponding attribute/feature. If initially `None`, it gets computed (by the function `setproblem`) from the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **distance**: The distance function used in the learner to calculate the distance between two items. By default `mean_boolean_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **name**: Name of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **source**: The source of the dataset (url or other). Not used in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **exclude**: A list of indexes to exclude from `inputs`. The list can include either attribute indexes (attrs) or names (attrnames).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- - ```d.examples``` — A list of examples. Each one is a list of attribute values.\n",
    "- ```d.attrs```    — A list of integers to index into an example, so ```example[attr]``` gives a value. Normally the same as ```range(len(d.examples[0]))```.\n",
    "- ```d.attr_names``` — Optional list of mnemonic names for corresponding ```attrs```.\n",
    "- ```d.target``` — The attribute that a learning algorithm will try to predict. By default the final attribute.\n",
    "- ```d.inputs``` — The list of ```attrs``` without the target.\n",
    "- ```d.values``` — A list of lists: each sublist is the set of possible values for the corresponding attribute. If initially ```None```, it is computed from the known examples by ```self.set_problem```. If not ```None```, an erroneous value raises ```ValueError```.\n",
    "- ```d.distance``` A function from a pair of examples to a non-negative number. Should be symmetric, etc. Defaults to ```mean_boolean_error``` since that can handle any field types.\n",
    "- ```d.name``` — Name of the data set (for output display only).\n",
    "- ```d.source``` — URL or other source where the data came from.\n",
    "- ```d.exclude``` — A list of attribute indexes to exclude from d.inputs. Elements of this list can either be integers (```attrs```) or ```attr_names```. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Normally, you call the constructor and you are done. Then you just access fields like `d.examples`, `d.target` and `d.inputs`. -->\n",

    "### Class Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions help modify a `DataSet` object to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sanitize**: Takes as input an example and returns it with non-input (target) attributes replaced by `None`. Useful for testing. Keep in mind that the example given is not itself sanitized, but instead a sanitized copy is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **classes_to_numbers**: Maps the class names of a dataset to numbers. If the class names are not given, they are computed from the dataset values. Useful for classifiers that return a numerical value instead of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **remove_examples**: Removes examples containing a given value. Useful for removing examples with missing values, or for removing classes (needed for binary classifiers).\n",

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked how to learn decision trees for classification, we switch to regression algorithms. Regression algorithms assume a continuous valued output, based on the values of input features. In this practical, we focus on linear regression learners. \n",
    "A Linear Learner is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables $x$ and the single output variable $y$. More specifically, that $y$ can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables $x$. Linear learner is a quite simple model as the representation of this model is a linear equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The linear equation assigns one scaler factor to each input value or column, called coefficients or weights. One additional coefficient is also added, giving additional degree of freedom and is often called the intercept or the bias coefficient.   \n",
    "For example :  $y = ax_{1} + bx_{2} + c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, for multivariate linear regression, we call the current model hypothesis $h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\vec{x})$, where $\\mathbf{w} = \\{w_{0}, w_{1}, \\dots w_{n}\\}$ are the weights, and $\\vec{x} = \\{ x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}\\}$ is a feature vector. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\vec{x}) = w_{0} + w_{1}x_{1} + \\dots + w_{n}x_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern hardware acceleration allows us to perform matrix multiplication very fast, so that efficient prediction in a linear model is made using a vector of weights, which we multiply by a vector with the input features, plus a dummy feature $x_{0} = 1$ to match the intercept term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\vec{x}) = \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} = \\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\vec{x} = \\sum_{i}w_{i}x_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm wants to generate a vector of weights $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$ that minimizes the squared error loss over examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^{*} = \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{w}} \\sum_{j} \\left( y_{j} - \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\vec{x}_{j} \\right)^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm first assigns some random weights to the input variables and then based on the error calculated updates the weight for each variable, using the following update rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{i} \\gets w_{i} + \\alpha\\sum_{j}\\left( y_{j} - h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\vec{x}_{j}) \\right) \\times x_{j,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
